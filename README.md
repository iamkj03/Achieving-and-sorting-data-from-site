Digital Forensic

Scenario

Let's say that there are people who leaked their personal information such as their account info, bank certificate info, name and so on because of a malware. The gathered information is uploaded in the server outside of the country. Fortunately, the directory was able to be achieved due to the vulnerability. Now the information has to be destroyed and know whose info has been leaked.

This two code helps to download the information of the server.
download_data_from_site.py - Code to download the data from data sorted by the information I need.
zipinfo.py - Code to show info of a zip file.
